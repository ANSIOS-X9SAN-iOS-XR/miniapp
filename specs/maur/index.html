			<h2>Abstract</h2>
			<p>This document lists user needs and requirements for people with disabilities when using miniapps. These user needs should drive accessibility requirements in various related specifications and the overall architecture that enables it. It defines the term user needs as used throughout the document and then goes on to list a range of these user needs and their related requirements. The document also maps the user needs and requirements presented in this document with other related specifications.</p>
			
			<p>This document is most explicitly not a collection of baseline requirements. It is also important to note that some of the requirements may be implemented at a system or platform level, and some may be authoring requirements.</p>
